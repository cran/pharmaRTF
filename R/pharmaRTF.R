#' @description
#' Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables
#' packages such as huxtable or GT. This package fills a gap where tables in
#' certain packages can be written out to RTF, but cannot add certain metadata
#' or features to the document that are required/expected in a report for a
#' regulatory submission, such as multiple levels of titles and footnotes,
#' making the document landscape, and controlling properties such as margins.
#'
#' This package intends to provide a flexible and reliable framework to connect
#' R to a pharmaceutical reporting workflow.
